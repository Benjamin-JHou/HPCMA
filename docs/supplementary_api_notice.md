# Supplementary API Notice

The FastAPI service under `src/inference/api_server.py` is provided for supplementary demonstration workflows only.

## Scope

- Demonstrates request/response formats for atlas-related risk scoring examples.
- Supports reproducibility checks for software interfaces.

## Out of Scope

- Clinical deployment.
- Patient-level treatment decisions.
- Regulatory or operational clinical-grade use.

## Manuscript Positioning

Primary evidence in the paper should rely on auditable atlas resource tables, schema-constrained database artifacts, and reproducible analysis scripts. API outputs are supplementary.
